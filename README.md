# Flight-Delay-Analysis - Visualization
I took part in this Hackathon of Flight Delay Analysis, where the goal was to understand the key factors through visualization that causes the delay and predict the possibility of delay in the future. I did all required preprocessing after visualizing the data and then created models such as Random Forest, XG boost which gave me good results.

File consist of jupyter notebook with all details and visualization.
